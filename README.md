# VillageProtector
 This is a solo gaming project I'm making in Unity/C# to improve my coding skills and game making knowledge.

- This game is meant to be high fantasy rpg genre
- Most of the assets used in the game are imported and made by others, however;
- The visual effects such as lightning strike effect and the fire effect are created by me
- The animations are implemented by me and their functionality coded by me

Features implemented so far:
- Player movement, jump, and attacks
- Enemy AI movement pattern/navigation, behavioural pattern, attack pattern, and health/the ability to be killed
-  Day/Night cycle
-  Inventory and equipment system
